# SpengBot
Offshoot of DiscAura for the college discord.
I created this bot using DSharp, a useful library for coding discord bots.
It's very basic, and experiments with the idea of assigning commands to specific users, so for example I have a shutdown command bound to my ID that closes the bot when I type the appropriate command in chat.
Not really sure that much about licenses and that, but if you use my code in your project i'd like to get some credit at least.
