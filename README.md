# SpengBot
Offshoot of DiscAura for the college discord.
I created this bot using DSharp, a useful library for coding discord bots.
It's very basic, and experiments with the idea of assigning commands to specific users, so for example I have a shutdown command bound to my ID that closes the bot when I type the appropriate command in chat.
This project is CLOSED SOURCE. That means you are not allowed to posess my code without my explicit permission.
If I catch any of my code being used in your project, I will be trying to get some royalties in the event it becomes monetised.
